# The Evolution of Fiqh<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> and Madhhab Prediction

This is a ["Natural Language Processing"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/07/02/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-what-is-it-used-for/#5f6a9fa65d71) project that aims to look at how the four main *madhāhib*<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> have both individually and collectively changed over time — from their inception by the "founders" themselves up until the current-day scholars who still produce works of *Fiqh* (Islamic Law).

This project will use machine learning (artificial intelligence) and the law books of the four schools (found on http://shamela.ws/ in their respective sections).

### I am a subject matter expert, but for additional prior data, I also surveyed other experts using this [`form`](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1IS6sKlZibQaI_rAHJ18Kmioi42m4VaLcsP-SNsRGFCrdow/viewform). Results will be available and displayed soon.

## Problem Statement
I hope to be able to answer the following questions:
1. Which words and phrases are the most specific to each school? (i.e., do *Ḥanafī*<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup> works often cite *“qiyās”*<sup>[4](#fn4)</sup> far more than *Ḥanbalī*<sup>[5](#fn5)</sup> works do?)
2. How do those school-specific words and phrases change from century to century? (i.e., do the earlier works predominantly quote *Qurʾān*<sup>[6](#fn6)</sup> and *Aḥādīth*<sup>[7](#fn7)</sup>, while later works simply reference back to the opinions of previous scholars?)
3. Can these keywords and phrases be used to accurately predict with which *madhhab* an author affiliates? (i.e., do the *ḥadīth* commentaries of Mullā ʿAlī al-Qārī [rḥA] and Imām al-Nawawī [rḥA] clearly mark them as *“Ḥanafī”* and *“Shāfiʿī”*<sup>[8](#fn8)</sup> respectively?)
4. [Time Permitting] Can I provide a summary of the texts in a manner that is both inclusive and exclusive, but still staying true to the original intent of the author?

Note:
1. The years and centuries used in this project refer to the Islamic calender, i.e., the *Hijrī* Lunar calender. For a quick conversion, it will be 578 years behind the current Gregorian calender.
2. I understand that limiting myself to only those books found within [Shamela](http://shamela.ws/) is not the best representation of the schools as a whole, but this is where there are data available for such a project.
3. I also understand that there are many books which have commentaries (i.e., for al-Marghinānī’s *al-Hidāyah*, there are at least 3 massive commentaries which include the entire text of *al-Hidāyah*: *al-Bināyah*, *al-ʿInāyah*, and *Fatḥ al-Qadīr*) which might skew the results. In the process, I will search for the optimal statistical and computational method in which to address this issue.
