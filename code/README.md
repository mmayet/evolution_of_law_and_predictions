# The Process

## 0. The Questions: 
1. Which words and phrases are the most specific to each school? (i.e., do *Ḥanafī* works often cite *“qiyās”* far more than *Ḥanbalī* works do?)
2. How do those school-specific words and phrases change from century to century? (i.e., do the earlier works predominantly quote *Qurʾān* and *Aḥādīth*, while later works simply reference back to the opinions of previous scholars?)
3. Can these keywords and phrases be used to accurately predict with which *madhhab* an author affiliates? (i.e., do the *ḥadīth* commentaries of Mullā ʿAlī al-Qārī [rḥA] and Imām al-Nawawī [rḥA] clearly mark them as *“Ḥanafī”* and *“Shāfiʿī”* respectively?)
4. [Time Permitting] Can I provide a summary of the texts in a manner that is both inclusive and exclusive, but still staying true to the original intent of the author?
